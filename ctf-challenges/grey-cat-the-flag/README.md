# Grey Cat The Flag

Grey Cat The Flag is a CTF competition organised by NUS Greyhats and the National Cybersecurity R\&D Labs. I participated this CTF along with CodeX and Incursion, hoping that we could \*at least\* get into top 10 XD. Wellllllllllll.....

We only managed to secure 15th place overall and 14th place in Singapore.&#x20;

I mean its probably because we were only to clear the misc and re challenges and being sad for the other categories :(((((((( (tbf we can't math so crypto was a shitshow for us HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)



Anyways I will be providing writeups for some of the more interesting challenges I managed to solve which include

* Angry Robot (RE)
* Flappy-o Flappy-o2  (RE)
* Runtime Environment   (RE)
* Runtime Environment 2  (RE)
* Memory Game 2  (RE)
* Block (Crypto)
